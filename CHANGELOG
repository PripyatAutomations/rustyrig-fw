* Improved GtkFreqEntry
* Code cleanup & some static analysis
* Temporary shell script based launcher for gst pipelines (./gst-test.sh called by test-run.sh)
* Made rrserver send error/warning messages to the client when invalid input is sent, rather than ignoring the input as previously done
* Changed mode dropdown to alt-d instead of alt-o
* Improved config parser:
  - Multiline entries, put a \ at end of the line, trailing whitespace ignored!
  - Variable expansion: ${key.name}
  - Allow stray whitepsace around the = in key/val sections
  - Whitespaces trailing and leading are properly scrubbed now
  - Work on reload events, so if/when we add reloading the config without a restart
* Added dict2json / json2dict (src/common/dict2json.c and inc/common/dict2json.h)
  - Supports turning a dict into a blob of json for sending to users
  - Soon will have json to dict, for parsing user messages into an easy to handle dict * object
* More code cleanup
