media.capab	- A list of pipeline 4CC's we support
media.codec	- Overlap of allowed codes and client preferred codecs

rf.freq-limits	- RF frequency limits for the RX and TX sections
rf.slicer	- Support for configuring hardware that uses FPGA slicing
                  (Radioberry, Hermeslite, USRP, etc)
