* Add throttled reconnect like webui has
* Finish parsing server messages
* Implement rest of controls typically used
* Finish GtkFreqEntry widget (gtk.freqentry.c) -- it's buggy!
* Finish whois/reason dialogs
* Add more error messages when privileges denied, etc. (server side)
* Fill out Config tab form which can generate rrclient.cfg
  - For now we have the text editor, bug check and fix it!
* Add a start/stop RX audio button for saving bw isntead of just muting
  - or maybe send the mute/unmute to server who will start/stop sending samples
    as well as sending a start/stop message so gstreamer can be paused

[win64]
* Testing and bug fixes

[bluetooth]
* Support bluetooth PTT buttons
* Maybe automate routing of headsets when connected, if reasonably feasible?

[winmgr]
* Emit a config line showing the window size/position for config save, etc
