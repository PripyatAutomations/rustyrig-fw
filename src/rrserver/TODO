[eeprom/config]
* more work to integrate config into eeprom
  - work on dict and just load/save changed parts of the eeprom
    - Read into new empty dict
    - dict_diff to get changed keys (include option to for unique flags only / both / only changed)
    - If eeprom write delay expired, save to eeprom
    - On exit, etc
  - read eeprom into config / channels dict on posix
