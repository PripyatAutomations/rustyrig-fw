This code is a bit of a mess. Right now I'm focused on getting it functional
then we'll go through and rewrite/cleanup each file.

I've made this mess in essentially a few weeks of spare time. Keep that in mind
before exposing it to the internet. Probably wise to use a VPN for now.

Mongoose httpd is well maintained and tested, but my code presently is not.

Feel free to contribute changes or improvements via github or .diff's!

Long story short, on a debian-based system do the following to try it:

   Make sure you have jq, make, gcc, etc
	apt install -y jq build-essential make

   Find your rig's model # in hamlib:
	rigctld -l | less

   Start up rigctld connected to your rig (example is dummy):
	rigctld -o -v -v -m 1 &

   Edit config/radio.config.json
	joe config/radio.config.json

   Install needed dependencies
	sudo ./install-deps.sh

   Fetch updates & submodules
	make update

   Build and run
	make
	make run

   Open a browser and connect to the http (port 8420) or https (port 4420):
	firefox	https://localhost:4420/
