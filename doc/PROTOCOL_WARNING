The protocol *WILL* change significantly between now and the first release.

Please feel free to write clients, just be aware the protocol *will* change.

Ideas for the new protocol are welcome, we just need to be able to meet a few goals:

	* Easily parsible in C, perl, and javascript. Other languages welcome.
	* All control messages must be text, only media can be binary frames.
	* Binary frames MUST use be same encapsulation on other transports (this makes IRC, etc difficult)
